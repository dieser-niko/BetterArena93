# BetterArena93
BetterClient/HackClient for Windows 93: Arena 93 Multiplayer (http://windows93.net)

## Disclaimer
I am not a professional JavaScript Coder, instead my main knowledge is in Python. That's why there might be some issues I haven't fixed. Also I don't want to harm the game experience of others even there aren't that many players. How I said, I'm not that good in JavaScript and this project here just was made for fun. If you are the Owner of Windows 93 or Arena 93 Multiplayer you can reach out to me on

## How to install
Currently I'm working on several ways to inject the script, but because I want to make this to work on several browsers, the onliest way to do that is by using the console. First of all open the game. Currently I'm always using the direct link to the game: http://windows93.net:8084. Then open the script you want to inject. Currently there are two versions, the [BetterArena93.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NikoHD203/BetterArena93/main/BetterArea93.js) (fair play) and the [HackedArena93.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NikoHD203/BetterArena93/main/HackedArea93.js). Copy the complete content. Then you have to open the console. For the most browsers it can be opened by pressing F12 and then clicking on 'Console'. Firefox even has its own shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + K. Then paste and press Enter. If there are any errors or other problems, just open up an issue.

## How to play
The replaced controls are:
Key | function
